# Web3 challenge project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies

I have used these libraries to implement this challenge:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - react framework
- [Material UI](https://mui.com) - UI Library
- [ThirdWeb](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/tree/main/packages/react) - thirdweb React SDK to connect to web3 wallets
